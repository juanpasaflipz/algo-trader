# Algo Trader Refactoring Migration Guide

This document tracks the incremental refactoring from the current architecture to the new plugin-based, scalable architecture.

## Overview

We're performing an incremental refactoring to transform the algo-trader codebase while maintaining full functionality throughout the process.

### Migration Principles
1. **No breaking changes** - The system remains operational at all times
2. **Feature flags** - New implementations can be toggled on/off
3. **Incremental changes** - One component at a time
4. **Backward compatibility** - Old code continues to work until fully migrated
5. **Continuous testing** - All tests must pass after each change

## Phase 0: Foundation (Current)

### 0.1 Directory Restructuring ‚úÖ
**Status**: Completed
**Goal**: Align directory structure with new architecture while preserving functionality

#### Changes:
- [x] Create `app/workers/` directory for async tasks
- [x] Reorganize `app/services/` into subdirectories:
  - [x] `app/services/data/` - Market data fetching and caching
  - [x] `app/services/strategies/` - Already exists ‚úì
  - [x] `app/services/execution/` - Broker adapters and trade execution
- [x] Create `scripts/` directory with CLI tool
- [x] Rename API endpoints to match new structure:
  - [x] `tradingview_webhook.py` ‚Üí `webhooks.py`
  - [x] `trade_controller.py` ‚Üí `execution.py`
  - [x] Create `auth.py` for authentication endpoints
  - [x] Create `profiling.py` for risk assessment
  - [x] Rename `backtest.py` ‚Üí `strategies.py` (includes backtest endpoints)

#### Migration Steps:
1. Create new directories ‚úÖ
2. Copy files to new locations (keep originals) ‚úÖ
3. Update imports to use new paths ‚úÖ
4. Test everything works ‚úÖ
5. Remove old files ‚è≥ (keeping for now to ensure backward compatibility)
6. Update all references ‚úÖ

### 0.2 Task Queue Implementation ‚úÖ
**Status**: Completed
**Goal**: Add Celery + Redis for async operations

#### Changes:
- [x] Added Celery to dependencies in pyproject.toml
- [x] Created `app/core/celery_app.py` with Celery configuration
- [x] Updated config.py with Celery broker/backend settings
- [x] Created `app/workers/tasks.py` with async tasks:
  - [x] `run_backtest` - Async backtest execution with progress tracking
  - [x] `analyze_trade_with_ai` - AI analysis in background
  - [x] `process_webhook` - Webhook processing queue
  - [x] `batch_analyze_signals` - Batch signal processing
  - [x] Periodic tasks for health checks and cleanup
- [x] Created `celery_worker.py` entry point
- [x] Updated docker-compose.yml with:
  - [x] Celery worker service
  - [x] Celery beat service for periodic tasks
  - [x] Flower service for task monitoring (port 5555)
- [x] Created `app/api/v1/tasks.py` for task management endpoints
- [x] Updated webhook endpoint to support async processing flag

#### New Capabilities:
- Long-running backtests don't block API requests
- AI analysis can be queued for batch processing
- Webhook processing can be made async for high throughput
- Task progress tracking with real-time updates
- Task cancellation support
- Flower UI for monitoring tasks at http://localhost:5555

### 0.3 Centralized Telemetry ‚úÖ
**Status**: Completed
**Goal**: Single source for logging, metrics, and tracing

#### Changes:
- [x] Created `app/core/telemetry.py` with unified telemetry interface
- [x] Integrated structlog for structured logging
- [x] Added comprehensive Prometheus metrics:
  - [x] HTTP request metrics (count, duration)
  - [x] Trading metrics (trades, PnL, positions)
  - [x] Webhook metrics (received, processing time)
  - [x] Backtest metrics (runs, duration)
  - [x] AI analysis metrics (analyses, response time, confidence)
  - [x] Task queue metrics (tasks created, duration)
  - [x] System health and error metrics
- [x] Created telemetry middleware for automatic request tracking
- [x] Added execution timing decorator `@log_execution_time()`
- [x] Implemented distributed tracing context (placeholder for OpenTelemetry)
- [x] Updated existing logger module to use centralized telemetry
- [x] Added request ID tracking for correlation
- [x] Created example script demonstrating telemetry usage

#### New Capabilities:
- Structured JSON logging in production
- Automatic request/response tracking with timing
- Comprehensive metrics for all operations
- Error tracking with component attribution
- Execution time measurement for any function
- Context propagation for distributed tracing
- Request correlation with X-Request-ID headers

## Phase 1: Core Improvements üîú

### 1.1 Authentication Layer
- JWT-based authentication
- User models and management
- API key management

### 1.2 Plugin Architecture
- Strategy discovery via entry points
- Dynamic strategy loading
- Strategy registry

### 1.3 CLI Development
- Typer-based CLI
- Commands for backtest, trade, optimize

## Phase 2: Feature Migration üîú

### 2.1 Enhanced Webhooks
- Async processing with Celery
- Better error handling
- Webhook validation

### 2.2 Data Service Layer
- Abstract data providers
- Caching implementation
- Multiple data source support

### 2.3 Profiling System
- Risk questionnaire API
- Strategy selection algorithm
- User preference storage

## Phase 3: New Features üîú

### 3.1 Broker Adapters
- Binance paper trading
- Alpaca sandbox
- Common broker interface

### 3.2 Enhanced Monitoring
- Prometheus metrics
- Structured logging
- Alert system

## Rollback Procedures

Each phase includes rollback steps:

1. **Git tags** at each stable point: `pre-phase-0`, `post-phase-0`, etc.
2. **Feature flags** in config to disable new features
3. **Database migrations** are reversible
4. **Old code** kept until new code is proven

## Testing Strategy

- Run full test suite after each change
- Add tests for new functionality
- Performance benchmarks to ensure no regression
- Integration tests for critical paths
